# Itty for Tiny Life
A very small in-game social site. Fun for nobody!

## How it works
Simply click the Itty button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7095706/142358053-9f2ddd34-1ccb-4cf3-96c7-6217b313a56b.png) while playing the game to open Itty and check what your town members are up to.

The "Bit about {x}" action will be added to numerous objects. Clicking this will have this person post a Bit about that, or about anything if they selected themselves.

## Submitting New Bits
You can either open an Issue with the Bit you'd like to add, or open a PR.

Be sure to specify the key, disposition, and language to use if opening an Issue.
